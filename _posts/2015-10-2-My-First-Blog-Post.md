title: My first blog post!
---

Hello world! Although this is not my first foray into blogging (I made a food blog as a distraction tool for grad school. You can find it [here] (https://cynthesizingfood.wordpress.com/) if you're curious), it is my first attempt at writing a technical blog. However, because I am very interested in human interactions and relationships, this blog will include discussions about the social side of programming, soft skills in the workplace, and lessons I have learned so far in my life. 

But first, a little about myself. I grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico, but have not watched Breaking Bad. I attended college at UT Austin studying chemical engineering, and then, attended graduate school at UC Berkeley. However, seven years and two degrees later, I realized that I no longer wanted to pursue a career in research or in the chemical engineering industry. And upon this realization, like most 20-somethings with type-A personalities who have never experienced failure before do, I freaked out. But over the past two years, I have managed to calm down, find a few things I'm interested in pursuing as careers, and enjoy life. And through this blog, I'd like to share what I've learned from my experiences so far with anyone who may be experiencing something similar.

<!-- After graduating from college, I had the rather shocking epiphany that most 20-somethings have... I actually had no idea what the "real world" was like. Even though college had been difficult at times, I hadn't experienced anything that truly humbled me. I graduated with hubris, believing that I knew how the world worked and if I just followed a specific plan, I would have a successful career and life. Well, I quickly found out that life usually doesn't not turn out the way you had exactly planned it. And that's ok. In fact, this realization ended up giving me the freedom to pursue anything I wanted.

<!-- However, coming from the fairly structured and predictable world of traditional schooling, where you could mostly control your fate (at least in terms of your academic performance), it was pretty difficult for me to learn and accept that everything was no longer under my control.
