title: My first blog post!
---

Hello world! This is not my first foray into blogging (I made a food blog as a distraction tool for grad school. You can find it here if you're curious: cynthesizingfood.wordpress.com), but it is my first attempt at writing a technical blog. However, because I am very interested in human interactions/relations, this blog will include discussions about the social side of programming and soft skills in life and the workplace.
