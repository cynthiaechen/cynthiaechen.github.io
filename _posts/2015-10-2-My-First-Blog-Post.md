title: My first blog post!
---

Hello world! Although this is not my first foray into blogging (I made a food blog as a distraction tool for grad school. You can find it [here] (https://cynthesizingfood.wordpress.com/) if you're curious), it is my first attempt at writing a technical blog. However, because I am very interested in human interactions and relationships, this blog will also include discussions about the social side of programming, soft skills in the workplace, and lessons I have learned so far in my life. 

But first, a little about myself. I grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico (unfortunately, I have not watched Breaking Bad). After graduating high school, I studied chemical engineering at UT Austin and then, attended graduate school at UC Berkeley. However, seven years and two degrees later, I realized that I no longer wanted to pursue a career in research or in the chemical engineering industry. And upon this realization, like most 20-somethings with type-A personalities who have never experienced failure before do, I freaked out. Over the past two years, I have been figuring out how to calm down, find a few things I'm interested in pursuing as careers (currently, I am pursing a career in web development), and enjoy life. And through this blog, I'd like to share what I've learned (and am still learning) from my experiences so far. 

<!-- Currently, I am attending Hack Reactor, an intensive programming bootcamp in San Francisco, CA. After spending nearly a year of soul-searching and questioning myself, I arrived at the conclusion that I wanted to pursue web development for my next career. Although I knew quite a few people who worked as programmers and developers in the software/tech industry, I had never really considered it as a possible career option for myself until my younger brother asked for my opinion on styling for a website he was creating. It was only after he pointed out that I might have an eye for design that I started to seriously consider web development. A couple months of studying Javascript later, I applied to Hack Reactor and got in! Now I've finished the first half of the program and have learned enough to build a full-stack web application! -->

<!-- After graduating from college, I had the rather shocking epiphany that most 20-somethings have... I actually had no idea what the "real world" was like. Even though college had been difficult at times, I hadn't experienced anything that truly humbled me. I graduated with hubris, believing that I knew how the world worked and if I just followed a specific plan, I would have a successful career and life. Well, I quickly found out that life usually doesn't not turn out the way you had exactly planned it. And that's ok. In fact, this realization ended up giving me the freedom to pursue anything I wanted.

<!-- However, coming from the fairly structured and predictable world of traditional schooling, where you could mostly control your fate (at least in terms of your academic performance), it was pretty difficult for me to learn and accept that everything was no longer under my control.
