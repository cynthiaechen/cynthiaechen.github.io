Hi, I'm Cynthia! I am currently a student at Hack Reactor. I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Chemical Engineering from UT Austin and UC Berkeley, respectively. I worked as a Program/Project manager at Lam Research Corporation for a year before deciding to pursue a career in web development.

### More Information

In my free time, I like to read, run, do yoga, cook/bake, and travel. I am very interested in the intersection between tech and mental health and education.
