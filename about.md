Hi, I'm Cynthia! I am currently a student at Hack Reactor, learning web development. I spent several years studying chemical engineering, or as I like to think of it, how to explain how our physical world works. My interests have since shifted to understanding human behavior and interactions and cultivating healthy relationships. In particular, I am very interested in the intersection between technology, mental health, and education.

In my free time, I like to have meaningful conversations, read classic literature and non-fiction, run long distances, practice yin yoga, and travel.
